# Foo-add-and-sort-methods-for-implementing-computational-server-supporting-synchronous-RPCs-in-python
foo, add and sort methods for implementing computational server supporting synchronous RPCs in python, we have used python built-in function socket. We have implemented the server and client and run them. This uses socket library for communication and allows us to implement a computational server which supports synchronous RPC.
